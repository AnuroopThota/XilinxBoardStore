######### ADM-PA100/2MS change log ##############

1.0 - Vivado 2021.x
ADM-PA100 Initial board support

1.1
Fixed CIPS IP preset so that block automation and "Board Interface" setting on CIPS IP customization GUI should now work correctly.
Changed CIPS IP block automation preset to only configure peripherals, PS reference clock & MIO I/O standards.
Added CIPS IP presets for (a) Linux-capable configuration and (b) minimal configuration for booting the ACAP without peripherals.

1.2
Improved the way DDR4 SDRAM bank 1 interface is defined so that flipped pinout is correctly set regardless of single controller vs. 2 interleaved controllers choice. New designs should use "ddr4_bank1" interface in all cases but "ddr4_bank1_ilv" and "ddr4_bank1_non_ilv" interfaces are retained for backwards compatibility with older designs.
SLEW for unidirectional DDR4 SDRAM pins is now MEDIUM (as opposed to FAST), to resolve SI issues caused by faster edge rate in newer Versal ACAPs.
Added si5328_refclk_in2 component, interface & pins for rev. 4 board and later.
No longer sets DM/DBI-related properties to force use of DBI for DDR4 SDRAM controllers; user can now decide whether or not to use DBI for reads and/or writes.
